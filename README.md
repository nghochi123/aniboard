# Aniboard

## Introduction

An building-in-progress web-"app" that allows you to get information about the latest, trending and popular anime.

Not sure where I would like this to go, just a for-fun project.

Using Material-UI sparringly, mainly for layouts and icons - don't want to depend on it too much.

## Features

* Get anime by Popular, Trending and Top Rated.
* Search by name.
* Add anime to your list so that you can come back to it later on.
